          The idea of this project is to develop a system that can translate
              handwritten text into characters in an existing character set with
              the help of machine learning methods. For the system to be of use
              to people in everyday life it needs to be fast and efficient while
              maintaining high recognition accuracy.

              We got the idea to create Handwritten font when we noticed that a
              lot of people are writing things that takes a lot of time and
              would be easier if they could somehow use a font in their
              handwriting.
              <br /><br />
              The crux of the idea is to accept alphabets written in user's
              handwriting then mapping them to characters present in the
              existing character set and then creating a font out of it in
              user's handwriting.
              <br /><br />
              We figured that if we could create a tool that could translate
              handwritten text into typed text, it would be a huge time-saver.

            <div class="text">
              Here's how it works: First, the user uploads their handwritten
              text into the platform. The algorithm converts the handwritten
              letter into vector images, which are then analyzed for shapes and
              strokes and mapped into a vector code. Next, a font is created in
              the user's handwriting style and uploaded into the platform.
              <br /><br />
              To recognize handwritten letters, we first convert the vector
              images into a digital code. Then we train the neural net using
              this code and the characters available in the MNIST database and
              assign each of the characters to a pixel in the input image. The
              neural net is then able to recognize handwritten letters by
              finding the patterns in the digital code.
              <br /><br />
              Overall, our deep learning-based approach achieves high accuracy
              while significantly reducing the computational complexity compared
              with the current state-of-the-art methods.

            It has been observed that learning to write can be a difficult
              task for children. This is because children have to go through
              several cognitive developments in order to attain the ability to
              write. These include the development of Motor Skills and the
              ability to integrate Written Language with Spoken Language.
              <br /><br />
              One possible solution to this problem is to develop a program that
              can help children learn how to write by using alphabets and then
              analysing the most repeated errors so that they can identify
              mistakes and rectify them by recommending some tasks while also
              building confidence and improving their motor skills.
              <br /><br />
              First, users/parents have to fill in details like their name, age,
              gender, address, etc. Then users have to provide samples of their
              handwriting so that the algorithm can identify mistake patterns
              and recommend optimal solutions to it .

              Forgot to write your assignment? Facing the deadline? <br />
              No worries just upload a sample of your handwriting and let us do
              the magic. We generate a font that you can use to write the
              assignment in your own handwriting while meeting your deadline
              without breaking a sweat. <br /><br />
              This is how the it works: The user writes some text on a piece of
              paper and scans or uploads it. The algorithm analyzes how the
              letters are formed and translates the shapes into the
              corresponding letters in the typed language. Then, a font is
              created from the handwritten text and maps it to the alphabet that
              the user has selected. The user can create fonts in multiple
              languages and save the font for later use.
              <br /><br />
              Traditional image-based or sequence based methods for recognizing
              hand-written letters use complex algorithms which are
              computationally expensive and difficult to apply in real time.

           Design is a field wherein you create things and it has a way of
              reflecting what the creation is conveying, the mindset with which
              it was thought of. So the only challenge here is to use the AI to
              take the idea from a person's brain and transfer it onto the
              screen and into your hand through using AI.
              <br /><br />
              It can be used in graphic designing to make logo designs or
              various other designs in which fonts are necessary. This idea
              would help both the user as well as the customers as the designers
              can save time, money and other resources using this AI powered
              tool. This would make designing accessible to people at a low cost
              and would not stop them from using their creativity to the full
              extent by using this tool hence giving them the freedom to use the
              tool in full capacity.
              <br /><br />
              This would also not limit the customers to choose what character
              they want as they can use as many characters as they want or
              require, improving the efficiency of the business.
