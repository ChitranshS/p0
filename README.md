# Project Name: WriteItUp‚úçüèª
This is a landing page for product which works on AI.
The crux of the idea is to accept handlets 
or in simple words alphabets written in user's handwriting
then mapping them to characters
present in the existing character set and then creating a font out of it in user's handwriting.
### I have used bootstrap5 , typed.js and animate.css in this project
#### For typed.js thanks to www.mattboldt.com
#### For animate css you can visit www.animate.style
